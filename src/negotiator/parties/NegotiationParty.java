/**
 * Represents a Party or Agent used in negotiation. {@link NegotiationParty}
 * replaces {@link negotiator.Agent}. This can be used for bilateral as well as
 * multilateral negotiations. If you are using a protocol that inherits from
 * {@link MultilateralProtocol} you should also use {@link NegotiationParty} and
 * not {@link negotiator.Agent}.
 * <p>
 * <em>IMPORTANT</em> Implementors of this class must have a public no-argument
 * constructor. In fact we recommend not to implement any constructor at all.
 * Initialization will be done through
 * {@link #init(UtilitySpace, Deadline, Timeline, long)}.
 * <p>
 * All time that {@link NegotiationParty}s spend in their code, including the
 * time spent in their constructor and init calls, is subtracting from the total
 * available time.
