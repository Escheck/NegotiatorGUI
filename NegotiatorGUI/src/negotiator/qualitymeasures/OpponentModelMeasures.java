package negotiator.qualitymeasures;

/**
 * This class specifies a set of opponent model measures used to measure the performance
 * of an opponent model during a negotiation. Note that the measures are computationally
 * heavy and computed during the negotiation. This entails that it is recommended to use
 * the time-independent rounds protocol.
