/**
 * Base interface for Negotiation parties. All parties must minimally implement
 * this interface. This can be used for bilateral as well as multilateral
 * negotiations. <br>
 * All time that {@link NegotiationParty}s spend in their code, including the
 * time spent in their constructor and init calls, is subtracting from the total
 * available time.
 * 
 * <h1>IMPORTANT</h1> Implementors of this class must have a public no-argument
 * constructor. In fact we recommend not to implement any constructor at all.
 * Initialization will be done through
 * {@link #init(UtilitySpace, Deadline, Timeline, long)}.
 * 
 * <h1>history</h1> {@link NegotiationParty} replaces {@link negotiator.Agent} .
 * If you are using a protocol that inherits from {@link MultilateralProtocol}
 * you should also use {@link NegotiationParty} and not {@link negotiator.Agent}
 * .

 * @author David Festen
 * @author W.Pasman 21jul15
 * 
 * @modified W.Pasman removed all but essential code. Agents can use
 *           {@link AbstractNegotiationParty} to get more support from the
 *           parent class.
