/**
 * 
 * This is a pure interface definition, not a specific agent. Agents of this
 * type are compatible with the PocketNegotiator.
 * 
 * Agents in PocketNegotiator run on the server, in parallel with other threads
 * that may run the same agent. To be compatible, agents need to be
 * <ul>
 * <li>thread safe (maybe not, I'm not exactly sure how TomCat handles this)
 * <li>run efficient in multi-threading situations.
 * <li>should not attempt to do actions that violate security restrictions in a
 * Tomcat HttpServlet. eg, read or write files
 * <li>should return different bids each time. Repeating bids may lead to PN
 * showing the message "I do not have further suggestions".
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * A PocketNegotiatorAgent adds new updateProfile functions to the agent. These
 * functions allow PocketNegotiator to change the profile while the agent is
 * running. The agent must handle these new functions properly.
