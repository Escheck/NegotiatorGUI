/**
 * #915 Agents of this type are compatible with the PocketNegotiator.
 * 
 * Agents in PocketNegotiator run on the server, in parallel with other threads
 * that may run the same agent. To be compatible, agents need to be thread safe
 * and run efficient in multi-threading situations. Also, they should not
 * attempt to do actions that violate security restrictions in a Tomcat
 * HttpServlet.
 * 
 * A PocketNegotiatorAgent adds new updateProfile functions to the agent. These
 * functions allow PocketNegotiator to change the profile while the agent is
 * running. The agent must handle these new functions properly.
