	2011 International Competition},
  journal = {Artificial Intelligence Journal},

  abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth analysis and the key insights gained
	from the Second International Automated Negotiating Agents Competition
	(ANAC 2011). ANAC is an international competition that challenges
	researchers to develop successful automated negotiation agents for
	scenarios where there is no information about the strategies and
	preferences of the opponents. The key objectives of this competition
	are to advance the state-of-the-art in the area of practical bilateral
	multi-issue negotiations, and to encourage the design of agents that
	are able to operate effectively across a variety of scenarios. Eighteen
	teams from seven different institutes competed. This paper describes
	these agents, the setup of the tournament, including the negotiation
	scenarios used, and the results of both the qualifying and final
	rounds of the tournament. We then go on to analyse the different
	strategies and techniques employed by the participants using two
	methods: (i) we classify the agents with respect to their concession
	behaviour against a set of standard benchmark strategies and (ii)
	we employ empirical game theory (EGT) to investigate the robustness
	of the strategies. Our analysis of the competition results allows
	us to highlight several interesting insights for the broader automated
	negotiation community. In particular, we show that the most adaptive
	negotiation strategies, while robust across different opponents,
	are not necessarily the ones that win the competition. Furthermore,
	our EGT analysis highlights the importance of considering metrics,
	in addition to utility maximisation (such as the size of the basin
	of attraction), in determining what makes a successful and robust
	negotiation agent for practical settings.},

  abstract = {Every year, automated negotiation agents are improving on various
	domains. However, given a set of automated negotiation agents, current
	methods allow to determine which strategy is best in terms of utility,
	but not so much the reason of success. In order to study the performance
	of the individual components of a negotiation strategy, we introduce
	an architecture that distinguishes three components which together
	constitute a negotiation strategy: the bidding strategy, the opponent
	model, and the acceptance strategy. Our contribution to the field
	of bilateral negotiation is twofold: first, we show that existing
	state-of-the-art agents are compatible with this architecture by
	re-implementing them in the new framework; secondly, as an application
	of our architecture, we systematically explore the space of possible
	strategies by recombining different strategy components, resulting
	in negotiation strategies that improve upon the current state-of-the-art
	in automated negotiation.}

	as well as general and contrasting approaches towards negotiation
